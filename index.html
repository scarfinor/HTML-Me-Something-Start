      <h3>1.Design</h3>
      <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
        People build retaining walls for a variety of different reasons. The
        first and probably most important reason for building a retaining wall
        in you yard is to combat negative slope towards your homes foundation.
        The second reason is to hide foundation walls that otherwise would be
        exposed. The third reason someone would build a retaining wall system is
        a raised garden bed. It is important to think about what you want you
        retaining wall to do when choosing the shape size or color of your wall.
        There are many different variations of size and color block that you can
        choose from. The most common block size is 12x18x6. It give you a strong
        foot print to insure your retaining wall system will not move.
      </p>
      <h3>2.Base</h3>
      <p>
        The first step in building a retaining wall system is to dig a trench
        big enough and deep enough for you your materials to be encapsulated.
        standard convention is to dig a 12x12 trench for the total length of
        your wall. Once the Trench is dug you can begin to fill the trench with
        a strong base material like inch minus or 1 inch clean crushed crock.
        The next step is to compact the rock down so that it will not move after
        this step it is time to start setting blocks into the rock base.
      </p>
      <h3>3.Stacking</h3>
      <p>
        After you have laid a sturdy and level base you can begin stacking
        blocks on top of your base blocks. It is important to start your next
        course on top of the center of two base blocks. Once your course is set
        you need to secure them down with a interlocking pin system. At this
        point your retaining wall system should be taking shape and ready to
        fill.
      </p>
      <h3>4.Back Fill</h3>
      <p>
        Now that your wall is stacked to height you can begin the back filling
        process. This is where you will take raw materials like dirt or rock and
        fill the empty space behind the block. this step will be the body of
        your project. If you are planing to have a strong structure to walk or
        drive on top of it is a good idea to fill with rock. If you are using
        the retaining wall system as a raised garden bed you can just use top
        soil for planting soil.
      </p>
      <h3>Cap</h3>
      <p>
        Cap is the final step in building a good retaining wall system. Cap is a
        slightly smaller version of the block you used to base and stack your
        wall that has a smooth top. It is used to cover any gaps or holes from
        the top of the wall giving it a polished finishing look. The cap are
        installed by a flush cut method and then glued in place on top of your
        stacking blocks.
